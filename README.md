### Bonjour|Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Damien!

**I'm a software crafter, currently senior consultant & CTO @ [Zenika MontrÃ©al](https://www.zenika.ca)**

I am a passionate developer for more than 13 years. Convinced that working software is good but not enough, I work with my clients mainly as a Tech Lead in agile projects to build well-crafted software. I have worked as a Tech Lead for high stakes projects such as government websites or international sports tournaments websites.

I also like to share my knowledge and therefore I am a trainer on software development practices such as [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), and I regularly present talks in meetups or conferences such as [Devoxx France](https://www.devoxx.fr/). 

Finally, I am a co-organizer of the [Software Crafters Montreal meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Software-Crafters-Montreal/) and co-founder of the [SoCraTes Canada conference](http://socrates-ca.github.io/).

I can help you if you have one of these symptoms:
* Difficulties to add new features to an existing legacy codebase
* More time spent to fix bugs than to add new features
* No clear definition of what clean code or software quality are
* Not sure how to write good automated tests and which kind of tests you should write
* Too much technical debt
* Having still the same issues even when working on a codebase started less than 1 year ago
* Willing to create a well-crafted software that you won't throw away in 3 years

Feel free to contact me or visit my [personal website](https://damienbeaufils.dev/)!
