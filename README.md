### Bonjour|Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Damien!

**I'm a freelance software crafter, owner @ [CLWeb Charlevoix](https://clweb-charlevoix.ca/)**

With more than 15 years of experience in software development, I started my own business after spending more than half of my career as an IT consultant in companies of different industries (banking, insurance, energy, utilities, media, sports...) and different sizes (from small companies to multinationals). I live in Quebec, and I speak English and French.

I am a full stack developer since the beginning of my career, and I have a major historical expertise in Java / Spring backend, framework for which I am certified (Spring Professional in 2020).
I was a consultant for almost 10 years, and in my last experience before my entrepreneurial leap, I was CTO of an IT consulting company for more than 3 years, in parallel to my role as a software developer and senior consultant.

Designing quality software is my passion, and I like to be proud of the work done. In addition to my mandates, I spend a lot of time constantly training myself to stay on top of the latest technology, in order to be able to provide the best solutions to your various challenges.

I am an expert in the quality of development practices, also called Software Craftsmanship practices (practices such as Clean Code, Refactoring, Test Driven Development...) and I am certified on several technologies as well as on the eco-design of digital services (GreenIT).
I also had the opportunity to be a speaker in famous technical conferences such as Devoxx in France or Web Ã€ QuÃ©bec.

I like to develop scalable and maintainable software in a team, and to share this know-how with others. I like to work with inclusive and caring teams, who also practice these software development techniques, or who wish to progress on them.
